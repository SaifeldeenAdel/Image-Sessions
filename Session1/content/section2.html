		<h1>Image Operations</h1>
		<p>
			There are so many ways to modify image arrays, we will explore some of the
			most common and useful ones in our work. <br />
			Starting with your normal addition and subtraction of pixel values which
			results in brighter and darker images. <br />
			<b
				>Be careful adding to images of type uint8 as this may cause an overflow
				demonstrated in the notebook</b
			>
		</p>
    <br>
		<h3>Image partitioning</h3>
		<p>
			Sometimes you will need to crop out a certain part of your image to get rid of
			something. <br />
			This can easily be done using numpy indexing similar to what we did before.
		</p>

		<h3>Image resizing</h3>
		<p>A problem we will face when working with multiple images later is them being of different dimensions. So we need to learn how to get an image into our desired dimensions. <br> Additionally you might also want to resize an image to create a smaller image with the same aspect ratio  </p>

    <h3>Rotation and Reflection</h3>
		<p>Built in functions in openCV let you rotate images by multiples of 90 and reflect them along the y or x axes.</p>
