    <h1>Working with Multiple Images</h1>
    <h3>Mathematical Operations</h3>
    <p>In order to perform any operations with 2 or more images together, we need to ensure they have the same dimensions and <br> we'll do this using the resize function we saw before.</p>

    <h3>Image Concatenation</h3>
    <p>We might also want to stitch together multiple images side by side or in a grid. <br> So you will learn how to use resizing and indexing to create a new image from concatenating multiple images together.</p>

    <h3>Feature Matching</h3>
    <p>When multiple images are shot at different angles but have a feature in common, <br>we can display these matches using multiple different matching algorithms which you can reads about <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/dc/dc3/tutorial_py_matcher.html">here</a>.</p>
