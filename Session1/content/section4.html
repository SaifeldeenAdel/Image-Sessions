		<h1>Image thresholding</h1>
		<p>
			Thresholding is important when we want to focus on specific properties in the
			image and neglect the rest based on the color. You can find more about
			thresholding from this
			<a href="https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d7/d4d/tutorial_py_thresholding.html"
				>link</a
			>.
		</p>
		<h3>Simple Thresholding</h3>
		<p>
      Simple thresholding produces a binary image where the pixels that exceed the threshold value is set to 0 and the rest is set to 255 <br>
			As shown in the notebook, 2 images were produced where colors are reversed,
			this is due to using CV2.THRESH_BINARY and CV2.THRESH_BINARY_INV where INV
			reverses the colors. <br> <br> If we don't want a binary image, then we could the
			TO_ZERO threshold where false pixels are only replaced by 0.
		</p>

    <h3>Adaptive Thresholding</h3>
		<p>
      Due to different lighting conditions, a fixed value for the threshold is not a good case. <br> Try switching between ADAPTIVE_THRESH_GAUSSIAN_C and ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, also try changing the kernel size and the constant.
