		<h1>Mouse Events and callbacks</h1>
		<p>
			Images displayed using OpenCV can have a mouse callback function attached to
			them
		</p>
		<h3>What's a callback function?</h3>
		<p>
			It is a function that runs as a result of a certain event occuring. In our
			case, when we attach a mouse callback function to an image, whenever a mouse event occurs (click, double click ,etc), this function runs. <br> In openCV this function takes in a lot of paramters, most importantly though are the event and the x ,y coordinates. You can learn more about how a callback function works in our notebook and <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/handle-mouse-events-in-python-opencv/">here</a>
		</p>

    <h3>Drawing on our images</h3>
		<p>
			Often times we need to draw shapes on our images. Whether its a bounding box
			to detect a certain object or its some lines to detect edges or straight lines
			for example. <br>
      These can be done as a result of a mouse event or as part of a detection algorithm. <br>
			In OpenCV, there are built in functions for drawing over your images. For
			example if you need to draw a rectangle, you might find <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=drawing+a+rectangle+opencv">these results</a> helpful.
